# Chaos Game (Sierpinski triangle)

## Simple program written in Python, with the Turtle library, to reproduce the Sierpinski triangle.

The [Sierpinski triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) is a fractal with the shape of an equilateral triangle. 
I heard for the first time of a Sierpinski triangle a few days ago from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBI_5GdvqUo) about [Chaos game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game).
